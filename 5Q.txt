The Document Type Declaration, often abbreviated as DOCTYPE, is an important declaration in an HTML document that specifies the version of HTML or XHTML being used.
 It helps browsers to correctly interpret and render the web page. The DOCTYPE declaration is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the `<html>` tag.
 example: <!DOCTYPE html>
`html`refers to HTML5, the latest version of the HTML standard as of my last training data in January 2022. HTML5 is widely used for modern web development. The DOCTYPE declaration is not an HTML tag; it is a directive to the browser about the version of HTML the document is using.
Before HTML5, different versions of HTML had different DOCTYPE declarations, and specifying the correct version was crucial for browsers to render the page accurately. However, with HTML5, the DOCTYPE declaration is simplified, making it easier for developers. The HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration triggers the browser to render the page in standards mode, which helps ensure consistent and expected behavior across different browsers.
Including the DOCTYPE declaration is considered good practice in HTML documents, as it helps prevent browsers from slipping into quirks mode, which could lead to inconsistencies in rendering. It also contributes to the overall validity and compatibility of the HTML code.

In HTML, a tag is a fundamental building block used to define elements within a document. 
Tags are surrounded by angle brackets ("<" and ">"), and they typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
 The opening tag begins with the tag name, followed by any attributes, and the closing tag includes a forward slash before the tag name.
  Elements are formed by the combination of opening and closing tags, and they represent the structure and content of a document.

    <!-- The <p> tag defines a paragraph element -->
    <p>This is a simple paragraph of text.</p>

    <!-- The <a> tag defines a hyperlink element -->
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>

    <!-- The <h2> tag defines a second-level heading -->
    <h2>Another Section</h2>
    
    <!-- The <ul> and <li> tags define an unordered list with list items -->
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
